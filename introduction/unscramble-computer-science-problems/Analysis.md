### Analysis for Worst Case scenario - Big-O Notation

## Task0

The function simply returns the first and last elements from the list without any sorting, so its time complexity is constant O(1).

## Task1

The script iterates over the list of calls O(n) and the list of texts O(p) sequentially, each loop having linear time complexity. Finally, the program converts a list to a set, which also requires linear time O(r).
Overall, the complexity remains linear, growing proportionally to the combined sizes of the calls and texts lists.

## Task2

The script iterates over all elements in the list to find the maximum value. Therefore, its time complexity grows linearly with the size of the list O(n).

## Task3

The third script contains two loops, each with linear time complexity O(n), as well as time constant calculations O(1). Then, the overall time complexity is still linear.

## Task4

The last script contains three loops, each with linear time complexity O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity remains linear O(n).
